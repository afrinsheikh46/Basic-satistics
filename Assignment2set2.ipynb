X1 and X2 can be a different subset of a sample from a similar source (population) but If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) then, 2 X1 ~ N(2 μ, 4 σ2 ) If X1 ~ N(μ, σ2) and X2 ~ N(μ, σ2) are iid normal random variables then (X1 + X2)N(μ+ μ, σ2+ σ2)(2 μ, 2 σ2) Hence, 2X1 – (X1+X2) ~(2 μ – 2 μ, 4 σ2 + 2σ2 ) The distribution remains the same for every sample subset of similar source, it tends to fall under Normal distribution and slight deviations in parameters.\n",
